# Set Up - Vagrant 3 VMs with ansible

1. Create a file called `vagrantfile` with the below configuration:

```vagrant
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The "2" in Vagrant.configure
# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for
# backwards compatibility). Please don't change it unless you know what

# MULTI SERVER/VMs environment 
#
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

    # creating first VM called web  
      config.vm.define "web" do |web|
        
        web.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-18.04"
       # downloading ubuntu 18.04 image
    
        web.vm.hostname = 'web'
        # assigning host name to the VM
        
        web.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.10"
        #   assigning private IP
        
        #config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.web"]
        # creating a link called development.web so we can access web page with this link instread of an IP   
            
      end
      
    # creating second VM called db
      config.vm.define "db" do |db|
        
        db.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-18.04"
        
        db.vm.hostname = 'db'
        
        db.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.11"
        
        #config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.db"]     
      end
    
     # creating are Ansible controller
      config.vm.define "controller" do |controller|
        
        controller.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-18.04"
        
        controller.vm.hostname = 'controller'
        
        controller.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.12"
        
        #config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.controller"] 
        
      end
    
    end
```
> 2. Type in vagrant up and wait patiently.

> 3. SSH into all three machines with a command that looks like this: `vagrant ssh controller`. Run updates and upgrades on all of them (`sudo apt-get update -y` & `sudo apt-get upgrade -y`).

> 4. Run these commands in the `controller` VM:
```bash
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install ansible
```
> 5. SSH into the two other VMs with the command `ssh vagrant@192.168.33.11` from the controller VM.

> 6. Go to the directory `/etc/ansible` in the controller VM with the `cd` command.

> 7. List directories nicely with this dependency: `sudo apt-get install tree -y`.

> 8. Edit the hosts file with this command: `sudo nano hosts`.

> 9. In the hosts file, insert these lines:
```bash
[web]
192.168.33.10 ansible_connection=ssh ansible_ssh_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_pass=vagrant
[db]
192.168.33.11 ansible_connection=ssh ansible_ssh_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_pass=vagrant
```
> 10. Check the connection to these other VMs with a command that looks like this: `ansible web -m ping`.

> 11. You should see Ping: Pong.

> 12. Run commands on the other VMs with this command (run it inside the controller VM): `ansible web -a "command here"`. For example, `ansible web -a "free"` or `ansible web -a "uptime"`. 

> 13. In your local host, run this command: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-scp
`.

> 14. Move the app folder to your VM controller with this command: `vagrant scp <some_local_file_or_dir> [vm_name]:<somewhere_on_the_vm>`. 

> 15. Move the app folder between different VMs with this command: `ansible web -m copy -a 'src=/home/vagrant/app dest=~/.'`. 

> 16. Go to `/etc/ansible`.

> 17. Create a new yml file with `sudo nano nginx.yml`.

> 18. Populate the file as so. Be careful of formatting (indent your lines properly):
```ansible

```

> 19. Run the yml file with the command `ansible-playbook nginx.yml`.

> 20. Go to the web VM's ip in your browser and check if it works.
